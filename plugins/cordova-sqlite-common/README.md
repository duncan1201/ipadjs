# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage (common version with limited functionality)
 
Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android, iOS, and Windows "Universal" (8.1), with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

License for Android and Windows "Universal" (8.1) versions: MIT or Apache 2.0

License for iOS version: MIT only

This version is a branch that is common to [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage) and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter).

## Status

- Windows "Universal" (8.1) version is in an experimental/pre-alpha state:
  - Database close and delete operations not yet implemented
  - No background processing (for future consideration)
  - You *may* encounter issues with Cordova CLI due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866); as a workaround you can install using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) and `plugman` as described below.
  - In addition, problems with the Windows "Universal" version have been reported in case of a Cordova project using a Visual Studio template/extension instead of Cordova/PhoneGap CLI or `plugman`
  - Not tested with a Windows 10 (or Windows Phone 10) target; Windows 10 build is not expected to work with Windows Phone
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); support for older versions is available upon request.
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree support is tested working OK in this version (for all target platforms Android/iOS/Windows "Universal")
- API to open the database may be changed somewhat to be more streamlined. Transaction and single-statement query API will NOT be changed.
 
## Announcements

- Windows "Universal" version now supports both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1
- iOS version is now fixed to override the correct pluginInitialize method and should work with recent versions of iOS
- The test suite is completely ported to Jasmine (2.2.0) and was used to verify the functionality of the new Windows version
- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Windows (8.1) in addition to Android & iOS is now supported by [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter)
- New `openDatabase` and `deleteDatabase` `location` option to select database location (iOS *only*) and disable iCloud backup
- Pre-populated databases support for Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire-OS is now integrated, usage described below
- Fixes to work with PouchDB by [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson)

## Highlights

- Drop-in replacement for HTML5 SQL API, the only change should be `window.openDatabase()` --> `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known; can be reconfigured (iOS version); and synchronized to iCloud by default (iOS version; can be disabled as described below).
  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
- Pre-populated database option (usage described below)

## Some apps using this plugin

- [Get It Done app](http://getitdoneapp.com/) by [marcucio.com](http://marcucio.com/)
- [KAAHE Health Encyclopedia](http://www.kaahe.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=817): Official health app of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
- [Larkwire](http://www.larkwire.com/) (iOS version): Learn bird songs the fun way
- [Tangorin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangorin.app) (Android) Japanese Dictionary at [tangorin.com](http://tangorin.com/)

## Known issues

- Multi-page apps are not supported and known to be broken on Android and Amazon Fire-OS.
- Using web workers is currently not supported and known to be broken on Android and Amazon Fire-OS.
- Triggers have only been tested on iOS, known to be broken on Android (without [sqlite4java](https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/)) and Amazon Fire-OS.
- INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using triggers, for example) does not report proper rowsAffected on Android (without [sqlite4java](https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/)) or Amazon Fire-OS.
- On Windows "Universal" (8.1), rowsAffected can be wrong when there are multiple levels of nesting of INSERT statements.
- Memory issue observed when adding a large number of records on Android and Amazon Fire-OS, due to JSON implementation
- A stability issue was reported on the iOS version when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time. The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).
- If a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the "deviceready" event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- The Android and Amazon Fire-OS versions cannot work with more than 100 open db files (due to the threading model used).
- UNICODE line separator (`\u2028`) is currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS version.
- Blob type is currently not supported and known to be broken on multiple platforms.
- UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character not working in Windows (8.1) (or Windows Phone XX) version(s)
- iOS version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to "synchronized" database access
- Large query result can be slow, also due to JSON implementation
- ATTACH another database file is not supported (due to path specifications, which work differently depending on the target platform)
- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.

## Limited support (testing needed)

- Database triggers as described above - known to be broken for Android (without [sqlite4java](https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/)) and Amazon Fire-OS
- UNICODE characters not fully tested in the Windows "Universal" (8.1) version
- JOIN needs to be tested more.
 
## Other versions

- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter) - supports [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android, iOS, and Windows (8.1)
- Original version for iOS (with a different API): [davibe / Phonegap-SQLitePlugin](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin)

## Other SQLite adapter projects

- [EionRobb / phonegap-win8-sqlite](https://github.com/EionRobb/phonegap-win8-sqlite) - WebSQL add-on for Win8/Metro apps (perhaps with a different API), using an old version of the C++ library from [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) (as referenced by [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8))
- [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) - C++ component that provides a nice SQLite API with promises for WinJS
- [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8) - old, unofficial version of Cordova API support for Windows 8 Metro that includes an old version of the C++ [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT)
- [MSOpenTech / cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/cordova-plugin-websql) - Windows 8(+) and Windows Phone 8(+) WebSQL plugin versions in C#
- [MetaMemoryT / websql-client](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-client) - provides the same API and connects to [websql-server](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-server) through WebSockets.

# Usage

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database:
- Recommended: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1});`
- Classical: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The new `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `0` (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the "deviceready" event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

**NOTE:** The database file name should include the extension, if desired.

### Pre-populated database

For Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire-OS (*only*): put the database file in the `www` directory and open the database like:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", createFromLocation: 1});
```

or to disable iCloud backup:

```js
db = sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 2, createFromLocation: 1});
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Put the pre-populated database file in the `www` subdirectory. This should work well with using the Cordova CLI to support both Android & iOS versions.
- The pre-populated database file name must match **exactly** the file name given in `openDatabase`. The automatic extension has been completely eliminated.
- The pre-populated database file is ignored if the database file with the same name already exists in your database file location.

**TIP:** If you don't see the data from the pre-populated database file, completely remove your app and try it again!

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which version is used:
- For For Android and Amazon Fire-OS, one background thread per db;
- for iOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);
- for Windows "Universal" (8.1), no background processing (for future consideration).
 
# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);
```

`location` as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS *only*)

**NOTE:** not implemented for Windows "Universal" (8.1) version.

# Installing

## Windows "Universal" target platform

**PREREQUISITE** in this version branch *ONLY*: install recent version of `sqlite3.[hc]` in `src/external` and make sure the following constants are defined: `#define SQLITE_TEMP_STORE 2` `#define SQLITE_THREADSAFE 2` and for Windows Phone 8.1 *only*: `#define SQLITE_WIN32_FILEMAPPING_API 1`

**IMPORTANT:** The Cordova CLI currently does not support all Windows target platforms (such as ("Mixed Platforms") due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866). As an alternative, you can use `plugman` instead with [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix), as described here.

### Using plugman to support "Mixed Platforms"

- make sure you have the latest version of `plugman` installed: `npm install -g plugman`
- Download the [cordova-windows-nufix 3.9.0-nufixpre-01 zipball](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix/archive/3.9.0-nufixpre-01.zip) (or you can clone [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) instead)
- Create your Windows "Universal" (8.1) project using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix):
  - `path.to.cordova-windows-nufix/bin/create.bat your_app_path your.app.id YourAppName`
- `cd your_app_path` and install plugin using `plugman`:
  - `plugman install --platform windows --project . --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common`
- Put your sql program in your project `www` (don't forget to reference it from `www\index.html` and wait for `deviceready` event)

Then your project in `CordovaApp.sln` should work with "Mixed Platforms" on both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`, or `windows`.

A posting how to get started developing on Windows host without the Cordova CLI tool (for Android target only) is available [here](http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html).

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common
 
You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

**WARNING:** for Windows target platform please read the section above.

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` platform-independent Javascript as generated from `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md` (and checked in!)
- `src`: platform-specific source code:
   - `external` - placeholder used to import `sqlite3.[hc]` in this version branch-needed to build Windows "Universal" (8.1) version
   - `android` - Java plugin code for Android and Amazon Fire-OS
   - `ios` - Objective-C plugin code for iOS;
   - `windows` - Javascript proxy code and SQLite3-WinRT project for Windows "Universal" (8.1);
- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0), ported from QUnit `test-www` test suite, working on all platforms
- `tests`: very simple Jasmine test suite that is run on Circle CI (Android version) and Travis CI (iOS version)
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0, using the `lib/android/example` subdirectory from the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball.

 - Install `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into `assets/www`
 - Install `SQLitePlugin.java` from `src/android/io/liteglue` into `src/io/liteglue` subdirectory
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="io.liteglue.SQLitePlugin"/>` to `res/xml/config.xml`

Sample change to `res/xml/config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

     <plugin name="Device" value="org.apache.cordova.Device"/>
```

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-19

(assuming Android SDK 19, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following changes to `SQLitePlugin.java`:

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

- Copy `SQLitePlugin.[hm]` from `src/ios` into your project Plugins folder and add them in XCode (I always just have "Create references" as the option selected).
- Copy `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into your project `www` folder
- Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml`

## Manual installation - Windows "Universal" (8.1) version

Described above.

## Quick installation test

Assuming your app has a recent template as used by the Cordova create script, add the following code to the `onDeviceReady` function, after `app.receivedEvent('deviceready');`:

```Javascript
  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db' }, function (db) {
    db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);
      document.getElementById('deviceready').querySelector('.received').innerHTML = 'stringlength: ' + stringlength;
   });
  });
```

# Common traps & pitfalls

- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the "deviceready" event callback.

# Support

## Reporting issues

If you have an issue with the plugin please check the following first:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

Then you can [raise the new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/new).
 
## Community forum

If you have any questions about the plugin please post them to the new discussion forum at [Ost.io / @litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](http://ost.io/@litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage)

Unit testing is done in `spec`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:
 
    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run then from a windows powershell do either

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

or for Windows (8.1):

    .\bin\test.ps1 windows

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option determines the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change the db filename using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

**NOTE:** For some reason, the PouchDB adapter does not pass all of its tests with this plugin.

# Contributing

**WARNING:** Please do NOT propose changes from your `master` branch. In general, contributions are rebased using `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and not merged.

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues at [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues) can help improve the quality of this plugin.
- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and are working for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible.
- If you see a need for restructuring, it is better to first discuss it in the forum at [Ost.io / @litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](http://ost.io/@litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage) (or in a [new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/new) where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Remember to make (and use) a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation with any other changes in the same commit.
